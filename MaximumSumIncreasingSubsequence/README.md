# Maximum sum increasing subsequence

Given an array of n positive integers. Find the sum of the maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in increasing order i.e. increasing subsequence. 


### Example 1
```sh
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {1, 101, 2, 3, 100} 
Output: 106
Explanation:The maximum sum of a increasing sequence is obtained from {1, 2, 3, 100}
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 6
Explanation:The maximum sum of a increasing sequence is obtained from {1, 2, 3}
```
