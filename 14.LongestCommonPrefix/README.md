# 14. Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### Example 1
```sh
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lower-case English letters.
```
