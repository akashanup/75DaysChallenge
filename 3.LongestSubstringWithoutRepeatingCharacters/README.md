Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Example 4
```sh
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

### Constraints
```sh
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
```
