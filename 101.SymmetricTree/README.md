# Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

[![symtree1](symtree1.jpg)]()
### Example 1
```sh
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

[![symtree1](symtree2.jpg)]()
### Example 2
```sh
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

### Constraints
```sh
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
```
