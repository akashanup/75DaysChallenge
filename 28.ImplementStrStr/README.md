# 28. Implement strStr()

Implement strStr().

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. 

### Example 1
```sh
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters
```
