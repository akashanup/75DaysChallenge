# 169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints
```sh
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```

### Follow-up:
```sh
Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
```
