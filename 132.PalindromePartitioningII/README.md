# 132. Palindrome Partitioning II

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: s = "a"
Output: 0
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: s = "ab"
Output: 1
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lower-case English letters only.
```
