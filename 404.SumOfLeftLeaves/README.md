### Example 1
```sh
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 24
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints
```sh
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```
