# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

### Constraints
```sh
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
```
