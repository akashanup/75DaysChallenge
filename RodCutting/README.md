Output: 22
Explanation: The maximum obtainable value is 22 by cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and 6, i.e., 5+17=22.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: N = 8, Price[] = {3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20}
Output: 24
Explanation: The maximum obtainable value is 24 by cutting the rod into 8 pieces of length 1, i.e, 8*3=24.
