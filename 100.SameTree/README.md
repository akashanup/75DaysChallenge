# 100. Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

[![ex1](ex1.jpg)]()
### Example 1
```sh
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

[![ex2](ex2.jpg)]()
### Example 2
```sh
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```

[![ex3](ex3.jpg)]()
### Example 3
```sh
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

### Constraints
```sh
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
```
