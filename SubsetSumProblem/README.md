# Subset Sum Problem

Given an array of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum. 

### Example 1
```sh
Input: N = 6, arr[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9
Output: 1 
Explanation: Here there exists a subset with sum = 9, 4+3+2 = 9.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: N = 6, arr[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 30
Output: 0 
Explanation: There is no subset with sum 30.
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= 100
1 <= sum <= 10^5
```
