# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

- a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

[![balance_2](balance_2.jpg)]()
### Example 2
```sh
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

### Example 3
```sh
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

### Constraints
```sh
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
```
