# 202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 02 = 1
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
```
