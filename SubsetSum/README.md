# Subset Sum

Subset sum problem is to find subset of elements that are selected from a given set whose sum adds up to a given number K. We are considering the set contains non-negative values. It is assumed that the input set is unique (no duplicates are presented).

### Example 1
```sh
Input: weights[] = {15, 22, 14, 26, 32, 9, 16, 8}, target = 53 
Output: [[15, 22, 16], [15, 14, 16, 8], [22, 14, 9, 8]]
```
