# 43. Multiply Strings

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

### Constraints
```sh
1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```
