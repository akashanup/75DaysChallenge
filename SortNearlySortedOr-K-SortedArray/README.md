# Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array

Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: arr[] = {6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9} k = 3 
Output: {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}
```
