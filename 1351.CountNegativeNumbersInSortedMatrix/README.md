# 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

### Example 1
```sh
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

### Example 2
```sh
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints
```sh
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
```

### Follow Up
```sh
Could you find an O(n + m) solution?
```
